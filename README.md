# BasicDefenseSystem
<br>

<p>
  Simple program that acts as a Defense System. 
  Defense Systems are a thing used for many different specific purposes, but all with the same goal of protecting something against potential threats. 
  This particular defense system is to protect your machine when you go "afk". It puts your machine in a defense system that throws alerts until deactivated.

## Features
<b>pynput :</b>
<p>
  library used for keyboard and mouse control listeners.
</p>

## How to use
<p>after cloning repo, and once in correct directory, simply run: <i>python3 main.py</i></p>
<p>
  Currently the program is set up to activate defense system using key:right_shift and to deactivate using key:esc (these keys can obviously be switched to your preference). 
</p>
<p>
The way it works is when Defense Mode is active, if there is mouse movement it sends alerts every instance of mouse location change. This is the interesting part where there is room for creativity for whatever you want. It currently is just set up to send messages in the CLI. But with some little changes you can make the alert system an audio, or pop up youtube videos, or memes, etc.
